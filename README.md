#     az-delivery-mini-mp3-dfplayer

## Description
This is a simple library I wrote for the AZ-Delivery MP3 DFPlayer Mini Module. I wrote it specifically for an STM8S105K4 microcontroller and these files should be used in combination with the STM8s Standard Peripheral Library. The *main.c* file gives an example of how the code can be used. Please refer to the datasheet (*Datasheet-AZ-Delivery-MP3-DFPlayer-Mini-Module.pdf*) for more information about the code's working principle.

## Prerequisites

### Cloning the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:michielskobe/AZ-Delivery-MP3-DFPlayer-Mini-Module-STM8.git
$ cd AZ-Delivery-MP3-DFPlayer-Mini-Module-STM8
```

### Downloading the STM8s Standard Peripheral Library

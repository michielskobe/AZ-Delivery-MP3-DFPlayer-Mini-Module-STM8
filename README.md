# AZ-Delivery-MP3-DFPlayer-Mini-Module-STM8-API
This is a simple library I wrote for the AZ-Delivery MP3 DFPlayer Mini Module. I wrote it specifically for an STM8S105K4 microcontroller and these files should be used in combination with the STM8s Standard Peripheral Library (https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm8069.html).
